# Om

_is a mantra, or vibration, that is traditionally chanted_

![enhancing your calm](http://i.giphy.com/3o7qDQ5iw1oXyDeJAk.gif)

## What is it?

Magical tool that helps you configure and deploy tiles to an Ops-Manager 1.8+ . 
Currently being developed by RelEng, backlog link is [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2982497).

## Design Goals

- less flakey / faster replacement of [opsmgr](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/opsmgr)
- single binary that can be run on multiple platforms
- split environment creation from Ops Manager configuration (these are two tools)
- no longer rely on specific environment file format
- fully tested, not using tests to execute browser behavior
- no capybara
- [small sharp tool](https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools)
- idempotency for all commands

## Documentation

See [here] (docs/README.md) for useful examples and documentation
